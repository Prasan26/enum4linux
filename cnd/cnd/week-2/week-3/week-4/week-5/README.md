# WEEK 5

 Social Engineering rely mainly on human interactions to get information about an organization. Attacker mainly seem confident and respectful, commonly claiming to be college, third-party entity or a researcher. Most of social attacker provide some sort of credentials to prove their identity as engaging in some old project, present well-know individual connections.

By asking question, attacker would be able to piece together enough information to infiltrate an organization network. Attacker often prepare list of people who should contact with some information about their role, responsibilities and  latest work engagements.

Principally Social engineering attacks depends on Vishing and Smishing attacks.

* **Vishing** attack is represented by calling certain number and divulge sensitive information,Advanced vishing attacks can take place completely over voice communications by exploiting Voice over Internet Protocol \(VoIP\) solutions and broadcasting services. VoIP easily allows caller identity \(ID\) to be spoofed, which can take advantage of the public’s misplaced trust in the security of phone services, especially landline services. Landline communication cannot be intercepted without physical access to the line; however, this trait is not beneficial when communicating directly with a malicious actor.
* **Smishing** Attack is represented by exploiting SMS or text messages. However  Text message would include links to such webpages, email links or phone address to convict victim this is real message so Victim would fall into such malicious activity and trust the attacker.

**common indicators of phishing attempts**

* Suspicious sender’s address
* Suspicious attachments
* Generic greetings and signature
* Spoofed hyperlinks and websites
* Spelling and layout

**Countermeasure for Social engineering attacks**

* **Be suspicious** of unsolicited phone calls, visits, or email messages from individuals asking about employees or other internal information.
* **Do not provide personal information or information about your organization**, including its structure or networks, unless you are certain of a person's authority to have the information.
* Do not reveal personal or financial information in email, and do not respond to email solicitations for this information
* If you are **unsure** whether an **email request is legitimate**, try to **verify it** by contacting the company directly.Information about known phishing attacks is also available online from groups such as the [Anti-Phishing Working Group \(Links to an external site.\)](https://apwg.org/). \(See the [APWG eCrime Research Papers \(Links to an external site.\)](https://ecrimeresearch.org/Resources/researchpapers/)\).
* Install and maintain anti-virus software, firewalls, and email filters to reduce some of this traffic.
* Take advantage of any anti-phishing features offered by your email client and web browser
* Enforce multi-factor authentication \(MFA\).
