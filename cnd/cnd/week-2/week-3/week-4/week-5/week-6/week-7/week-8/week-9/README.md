**Mobile Device Management**

Mobile Device Management \(MDM\) refers to the initiatives and products that an enterprise uses to oversee, streamline, and secure the company’s often-large supply of devices that workers use.

Whether company-owned or as part of a Bring Your Own Device \(BYOD\) policy, the diverse array of laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc. enrolled in the company’s MDM are meant to perform uniformly.

MDM is associated with smartphones but it is applied to mission-critical field equipment, laptops, tablets, and other outwardly deployed equipment such as mobile point-of-sale \(PoS\) terminals. Under MDM all of these [endpoints \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.hypr.com/endpoint/) are managed centrally though use of client-side software such as an application, and a central server and terminal where it is [orchestrated. \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.hypr.com/endpoint/) Admins push policies, applications, features, and updates from the central server to the endpoints over the air so all of the devices conform to a standard menu of capabilities, limitations, and features.

**Ways to Secure our Mobile Devices**

1. **Use strong passwords/biometrics**

Strong passwords coupled with biometric features, such as fingerprint authenticators, make unauthorized access nearly impossible. Your passwords should be eight or more characters long and contain alphanumeric characters. If your mobile device allows two-factor authentication, don’t hesitate to use it. You don’t want to be subject to [unforeseen attacks. \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/risk-based-security-for-executives/risk-management/the-unforeseen-impact-of-unforeseen-risk/)

The complexities of your passwords in other apps might tempt you to store them in a similar way a browser does – that is, using the ‘remember me feature.’ This feature should be avoided at all costs since it only increases the chances of your password getting spoofed. Alternatively, if you lose your device, another person might gain full access to it.

Furthermore, don’t forget to change your password from time to time \(at least every three months\).

1. **Ensure public or free Wi-Fi is protected**

Everybody loves free Wi-Fi, especially when the data plan is inexpensive. But cheap can turn expensive in a very devastating manner. That’s because most of the free Wi-Fi points are not encrypted. These open networks allow malicious people to eavesdrop on the network traffic and easily get your passwords, usernames and other sensitive information. That threat isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, either. According to [eVoice Australia \(Links to an external site.\)](https://au.evoice.com/), a premier provider of virtual telecommunications solutions, [Wi-Fi hacking \(Links to an external site.\)](https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/dangers-flight-wi-fi-airplanes-unique-hacking-grounds/) will constitute a growing risk for many in 2017.

To protect against Wi-Fi hacking, use applications that secure your connection or at least tell you the status of the Wi-Fi to which you are connected. WPA \(Wi-Fi Protected Access\) is more secure compared to WEP \(Wired Equivalent Privacy\).

As a matter of being cautious, you should also turn off wireless connectivity \(Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\) when you are not using them. Not only will this help avoid automatic connection to unencrypted networks but also save your battery.

1. **Utilize VPN**

If you’re not sure about the security status of the network to which you’re connected, using VPN \(Virtual Private Network\) client is mandatory. A VPN will enable you to connect to a network securely. At the same time, any browsing activity you do on the public Wi-Fi will be shielded from prying eyes.

It is also useful when accessing sites that are less secure. Non-HTTPS sites are visible to anyone who knows how to use networking and vulnerability tools. These sites are prone to MITM \(Man-in-the-middle\) attacks, which pave a way to eavesdropping and password sniffing. You really need to have a new mindset when it comes to [fighting cybercrime \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/risk-based-security-for-executives/connecting-security-to-the-business/the-new-mindset-required-for-making-a-dent-in-the-world-of-cybercrime/).

1. **Encrypt your device**

Most mobile devices are bundled with a built-in encryption feature. Encryption is the process of making data unreadable. Decryption is converting the unreadable data into normal data. This is important in case of theft, and it prevents unauthorized access. You simply need to locate this feature on your mobile device and enter a password to encrypt your device.

This process may take time depending on the size of your data. The bigger the data, the more time it will take. Most importantly, you need to remember the encryption password because it’s required every time you want to use your mobile device.

Also, as a fail-safe, consider backing up your data since some mobile devices will automatically erase everything if the wrong encryption password is entered incorrectly after a number of times.

1. **Install an Antivirus application**

The files you download and the apps you install on your mobile device might be packed with malicious code. Once launched, this code could send your data to hackers, thereby making you unsecured and robbing you of your privacy. To avoid that, installing a reputable antivirus application will guarantee your security.

Some [antivirus applications \(Links to an external site.\)](http://www.techworld.com/personal-tech/best-mobile-antivirus-what-consider-when-choosing-mobile-antivirus-3648194/) also offer more functionalities, such as erasing your data if you lose your mobile device, tracking and blocking unknown callers who might be a threat, and telling you which applications are not safe.

In addition, they offer to clear your browsing history and delete cookies. Cookies are small software tokens that store your login information that might be leaked if someone malicious gets to them.

1. **Update to the latest software**

Your mobile device firmware might also be vulnerable to security threats. New loopholes might be exploited leaving your device open to threats, to avoid that, always update your firmware/device. Major mobile device firmware companies, such as Google Android and Apples iOS, roll out new updates from time to time. Most of those updates act as a security patch to known vulnerabilities on your device. You might set up updates to be manual or automatic.

**Other things to consider**

* **Avoid turning on autofill** – Some websites and applications will automatically fill in your username when you visit them. This is due to the autofill feature. Turn it off as soon as possible.
* **Log out** – After using mobile applications, especially those that are linked to one another, such as google applications, ensure that you log off each time you are done using them.
* **Use only trusted stores** – You should download apps from secure stores, such as Apple’s App Store. This depends on the platform your mobile device uses.
