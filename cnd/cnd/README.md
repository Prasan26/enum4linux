Competitive intelligence, sometimes referred to as business intelligence, refers to the skill to gather, analyze, and use information collected on participants, customers, and other market factors that contribute to a business's cheap advantage. Competitive intelligence is important because it helps businesses understand their competitive environment and the opportunities and challenges it presents. Businesses analyze the information to create effective and efficient business practices.

How competitive Intelligence works

By definition, competitive intelligence assembles actionable information from diverse published and unpublished sources, collected efficiently and ethically.

there are some problems which will face in competitive field in competitive intelligence is:

1.\) poor competitive differentiation:  

Competitive intl was too general and didn’t differentiate based on specific competitors. The information was also feature-specific, rather than giving insight for employees to set the product apart with valued propositions. It really didn’t help the business stand out.

2.\) decentralized competitive intelligence: Information was being pushed out, but it was scattered all over the place. Employees would have to sift through old emails, docs, and slides in an attempt to find the insights they needed.

3.\) internal messaging was inaccurate: Out-of-date information is bad, but incorrect information is worse. There was a disconnect between what marketing said and what sales experienced; marketing campaigns pushed positive positioning slants that weren’t actually true

4.\) competitive information lacked strategic direction: 

There was no clearly defined strategy behind the competitive intelligence being gathered. Sales teams were just using the intel on an ad-hoc basis, rather than creating structured battlecards that could help them through every stage of the sales cycle.

It is the action of defining, gathering, analyzing, and distributing intelligence about products, customers, competitors, and any aspect of the environment needed to support executives and managers in strategic decision-making for an organization.  
Competitive intelligence means understanding and learning what is happening in the world outside the business to increase one's competitiveness.   
It means learning as much as possible, as soon as possible, about one's external environment including one's industry in general and relevant competitors.

Additionally, due to the explosion of user-generated content on blogs, forums, social networks, and more, there is now more information available than ever before.   
In fact, this has led to a new phenomenon named ‘information overload’.   
To deal with this exponential expansion of data, companies are relying on tools and apps that help them collect, process, and analyze data more efficiently.

#### Key Takeaways <a id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0"></a>

* Competitive intelligence refers to the ability to gather and use information on factors that affect a company's competitive advantage.
* Organizations analyze collected data and information to develop effective and efficient business practices.
* Competitive intelligence can be classified as myopic-oriented, tactical intelligence, or long-term focused strategic intelligence.
* Gathering data and information is more complex than conducting a simple Internet search.

While most companies can find substantial information about their competitors online, competitive intelligence goes beyond grabbing such easily accessible, low-hanging fruit. Only a small portion of competitive intelligence involves trawling the Internet for information. 

  
A typical competitive intelligence study includes information and analysis from various disparate sources, including the news media, customer and competitor interviews, industry experts, trade shows and conferences, government records, and public filings. But these publicly accessible information sources are mere starting points. Competitive intelligence also encompasses investigating the full breadth of a company's stakeholders, key distributors, and suppliers, as well as customers and competitors.
